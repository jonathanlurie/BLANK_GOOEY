# BLANK_GOOEY

This project is an empty nutshell using [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey). It also uses a sh script to be double-click launched.  

It is actually very similar to my other project [BLANK_PY](https://github.com/jonathanlurie/BLANK_PY), but with the use of an auto-generated simple GUI.

The exemple shown in BLANK_GOOEY are *timelapse oriented* because it was the base for my [TimelapseComposer](https://github.com/jonathanlurie/timelapseComposer)
